<h1>‚≠ê - Memory game</h1>
<br>
<p>Made this memory game as practice using javascript.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><b>Why am doing this?</b></h3><p>This is all part my 30 days 30 projects challenge!</p>
<p>This project is my <b>4th day</b> of this challenge <br> For the first day I did plain HTML and for the second I tried combining HTML and CSS. I skipped 2 or 3 steps on day 3 because I immediately started doing nodeJS. I already had experience scripting and/or programming since I've done a year on Python and Lua C</p>
