<h1>‚≠ê - Memory game</h1>
<br>
<p>Made this memory game as practice using javascript.</p>
<br>
<h3><b>PLEASE NOTE</b> The game doesn't have any scoring system yet! And there might be some glitches. Feel free to correct me anywhere, and don't forget to bump or start this project (I am new to github)</h3>
<br>
<h3><b>Why am doing this?</b></h3><p>This is all part my 30 days 30 projects challenge!</p>
<p>This project is my <b>4th day</b> of this challenge <br> For the first day I did plain HTML and for the second I tried combining HTML and CSS. I skipped 2 or 3 steps on day 3 because I immediately started doing nodeJS. I already had experience scripting and/or programming since I've done a year on Python and Lua C.</p> <br>
<p>Having a couple of steps skipped I came back and tried to implement my new js skills to learn DOM to make a dymamic website and I think it worked pretty well.</p>
